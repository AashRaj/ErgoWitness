# How to test the config file:

  sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

# Line 253 - Dynamic rules list
# Line 512 - White and black list rules

# This runs snort

  snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33 -l /var/log/snort/


# To use the binary to JSON converter thing use this: But right now it doesnt work

idstools-u2json --snort-conf /etc/snort/snort.conf --directory /var/log/snort --prefix snort.log_1 --follow --output /var/log/snort/snort.alert

# What did Ben change to get this half working?
# Comment out line 521 of the snort config
# The output on this line and the output from the line below were writing to
# the same file, and it was stopping the binary thing from working right
