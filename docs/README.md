# NetworkViz
3D Net is a Network Visualisation tool that shows network data in a creative way in 3D spaces. On the backend, the data is gathered by running tools like Bro, Packetbeat, and Snort, and pushing their logs in JSON format to the ELK stack (Elasticsearch). 

The ‘front end’ as I call it, is developed in the Unity game engine, pulling the information it needs down from the server with HTTP requests. By using a game engine like Unity to represent network data, there are not only possibilities of fun, interactive data analysis, but also the beginning of what could possibly be a very powerful Virtual Reality toolkit for network  professionals.
