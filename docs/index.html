<h1>What is Ergo Witness?</h1>
  <p>Ergo Witness is a network visualisation tool that shows network data in a
    creative way in 3D spaces. On the backend, the data is gathered by running
    tools like <a href="https://www.bro.org/" target="_blank">Bro</a>,
    <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat" target="_blank">Packetbeat</a>,
    and <a href="https://www.snort.org/" target="_blank">Snort</a>, and pushing their
    logs in JSON format to the ELK stack (Elasticsearch).
  </p>

  <p>The ‘front end’ as I call it, is developed in the Unity game engine, pulling
  the information it needs down from the server with HTTP requests. By using a
   game engine like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> to represent network data, there
    are not only possibilities of fun, interactive data analysis, but also the
    beginning of what could possibly be a very powerful Virtual Reality toolkit
    for network  professionals. </p>

  </ol>


<h2>How is The Data Collected?</h2>
<p>
  In order for this visualization to work, you need a source of network traffic.
   For network data, Bro, Filebeat, and Packetbeat are run on a capture server.
   These services then forward their JSON formatted logs directly to Logstash,
   which is where the data is aggregated. Then, Unity queries
   <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> using the web API.
